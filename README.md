## ABOUT

These are utilities for a performance in MaxForLive that I perform. I'm assuming familiarity with Ableton and Max in these descriptions. Due to the use of some commercial patches, I can't put the whole set up here.

Dynamicsnormalizer - if you put this on a track in Ableton, it sets the volume to -inf when that track is armed but not playing back a loop. I use this for my looper tracks (I wish auto monitoring in Ableton did this).

track routing - meant to send my guitar input (on which I put start_of_routing_patch) to the bus of the current track on scene cue + fade to the right deck. DeckAVol and DeckBVol are put on respective group tracks for each deck that have sends which start_of_routing_patch uses.

visuals - cute jitter patch that I put on my guitar input meant to impose the signal over alternating visuals of a logo changing color to the beat (as detected by Ableton's tempo) and webcam footage. It won't automatically open with the picture or open the webcam footage though. You'll have to import those yourself.
